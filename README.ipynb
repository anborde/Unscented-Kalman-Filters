    "- From the above observations we can see that the results obtained from UKF are far more better than EKF ( For EKF values please refer the README of [Extended Kalman Filters Project](https://github.com/anborde/Extended-Kalman-Filters) on GitHub.\n",
    "- Also, the UKF algorithm is much more efficient than the EKF algorithm as the estimation of Sigma Points is less complex compared to the highly computational Jacobian Matrix which is used in EKF.\n",
    "- Both, EKF and UKF have dominantly proved that a single sensor is not adequate to judge the position and velocity of an obstacle and **Sensor Fusion** is an important aspect of **Self Driving Cars**."
